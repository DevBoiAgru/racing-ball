# racing-ball
this is an early version of the upcoming update, just wanted to share my progress
so basically you can move around and stuff
im building up from ground up dw i will add everything back later
(the only reason im releasing this unfinished version is bc i promised to make an update before summer)

# controls
<ul>
    <li>WASD / arrow keys - move</li>
    <li>Left shift - dash</li>
    <li>Left control - stop</li>
    <li>T - change background</li>
</ul>
